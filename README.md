Craft integration with error monitoring service Rollbar.

## Installation

To install Rollbar, follow these steps:

2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins

Rollbar works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Configuring Rollbar

Youâ€™ll need to create a `rollbar.php` file in your `craft/config` directory and set your server access token via the `accessToken` configuration item.

```php
// craft/config/rollbar.php

return [

    'accessToken' => 'sAWNXugaQ2pusR9FqjGvTwyNaTV',

];
```

## Using Rollbar

You can use this plugin in your own plugins simply by using Craftâ€™s internal logging feature, however should you want to report exceptions or something directly you may do so via the service.

```php
// Reporting exceptions

try {
    throw new \Exception('Something went wrong!');
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    craft()->rollbar->reportException($e);
}
```

```php
// Logging

craft()->rollbar->reportMessage('Something happened.', \Craft\LogLevel::Info, [
    'foo' => 'bar',
]);
```
